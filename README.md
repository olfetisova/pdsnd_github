### Project Title
**Explore US Bikeshare Data**

### Description
In this project I have created the  Python code to explore data related to bike share systems of three major cities in the United States :us: - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. This code allows you to get the following information:
1. Popular times of travel
2. Popular stations and trip
3. Trip duration
4. User info

### Files used
In my project I used the three city datasets files:
* chicago.read_csv
* new_york_city.read_csv
* washington.csv

### Credits
I thank all teachers and mentors from the [Udacity school](https://wwww.udacity.com "Udacity home") who supported and inspired me during my study on the [Programming for Data Science with Python](https://https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104 "Course name") course.
